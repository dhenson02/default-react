Players and commissioners of leagues belonging to [My Fantasy League](http://myfantasyleague.com)

## How to use

### data/

Store the long-time JSON results here.  Stuff like league settings, players, teams, and other stuff that won't change often.

The other data (stats, updates, etc) can also be placed here but would be more beneficial to serve up on-demand from memory, depending on the user count.
