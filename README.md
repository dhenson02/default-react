# default-react

### My boilerplate using 
 - [Express JS](http://expressjs.com/) 4.x (eventually 5.x)
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) >= 0.14.6
 - [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) >= 6
 - [Kube CSS Framework](https://imperavi.com/kube/)

and plenty more (see package.json for details).

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build  # or build-dist, watch, or watch-dist
npm start
```

## Who this is for

Me and anyone else loving React needing a very basic boilerplate to start from but not wanting to redo the entire freaking code like most the others available.

## Credits

Please give credit to any of the authors of the attributed packages in the package.json file appropriately.  They all work very hard and deserve some extra traffic :)
